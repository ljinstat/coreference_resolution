# coreference_resolution
Coreference Resolution is a practical and challenging NLP topic . It aims to find out all words or phrases which are associated to the same real-world entities. One of the current state-of-the-art result is provided by End-to-End Coreference Resolution (Lee et al, 2017). This model has been already well implemented by a Python library AllenNLP. However, some features like speaker and ELMo embeddings are not considered in the library. This repository will provide complimentary implementations of the coreference model in AllenNLP.
